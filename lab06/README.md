# Task 1
I successfully encrypted this file in multiple different ways using -aes-128-cbc, cfb and ofb. I firstly created a plaintext.txt file and populated it with katy perry lyrics. Then I used the given command and encrypted the lyrics into cipher.bin, cipher2.bin and cipher3.bin. The only way to decrpyt these files would be to use the same cipher key with the -d command.
