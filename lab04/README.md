# Task 2.2
I was able to access the admin page by using the command curl 'www.seedlabsqlinjection.com/unsafe_home.php?username=admin%27%3B%23&password=' within my shell. I had to encode the special characters inputted into my username field with different numerical values.

# Task 2.3
I tried to change the Salary value for user Alice by putting the following command into the username field. admin';#UPDATE credential SET Salary = '30000' WHERE Username = 'Alice'. It did not work because the prepared statement countermeasure only compiles the first statement. Values which are transmitted later using a different protocol are not compiled like the statement template. If the statement template is not derived from external input, SQL injection cannot occur.  

# Task 3.1
I was able to complete this task but putting using the UPDATE feature within php. I did this by loggin into Alice's account and inputing ',salary='40000 into the NickName box.

# Task 3.2
I was able to complete this task by using the ',salary='1' WHERE ID=4;# command inside of ALice's Edit Profile feature. This changed Samy's salary value to 1 on the database.

# Task 3.3
I was able to change the password of Samy's user by putting the new password 'pass' into a SHA-1 hash calculator, then using the ',password='9d4e1e23bd5b727046a9e3b4b7db57bd8d6ee684' WHERE ID=4;# command to change Samy's password.

# Task 4.1
I was able to finish this task but rewriting my unsafe.php file code to use prepared statements. I did this by following the example givin in the lab instructions. Then after I did that successfully I went into my getinfo.php file and changed some of the values to bind_'value' in order to properly sync what was being called in my other file. After successfully doing this when attempting to use a SQL Injection attack or enter in a user and password incorrectly, I am outputed a table with no values. When inputing a correct user/pass combo, I am outputed that user's correct values.  
Code for my unsafe.php file.
