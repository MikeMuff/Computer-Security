- Looks good overall!
- You may want to fix up how you do the header of your submission. For reference, see https://www.traviswpeters.com/cs476-2021-spring/labs#example-structure-of-a-lab-report-readmemd
- Making use of [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org) features such as headers, lists, basic font formatting, links, images, etc., can go a long way. Be sure to spend some time making sure you have the basics down, and try to review some examples online to get a better sense for what others do.

I think if you continue to use Markdown and review different resources you'll get more of a feel for things. For instance, a 1 bullet list isn't really necessary. In that case, you can just have it be text before/after an image. Just little things like that. Keep up the good work! :-)
