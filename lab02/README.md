## Task 2.2
Using the -v command makes the displayed information print out more verbose. This means that it shows additional information to the user such as ip, port, server, date and more information ontop of the Enironment Variables and shows what curl is getting as a request.

## Task 2.3
Using the -A command allowed me to set the User-Agent field to whatever string I desire, then prints out the -v extension as well.

## Task 2.4
Using the -e command allowed me to set the "Referer" name to a string. This sends the "Referer Page" information to the HTTP server.

## Task 2.5
Using the -H command allowed me to change the header to a string. This creates an extra header to use when getting a web page.
